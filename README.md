# SQL-Housing-Data-Cleaning
This repository contains all queries related to data cleaning using SQL(SSMS). The raw data includes some errors, prompting the need for cleaning to enhance the accuracy and consistency of the dataset. In this project, I employed SQL string functions to filter and eliminate invalid, duplicated, and corrupted data. Consequently, the data has been modified and updated, generating fields that contribute to the improvement of the analysis process.
